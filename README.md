### Introduction
The team consisting of myself, [Femi Tunde Adedipe](https://twitter.com/Originalfemo) and [Mohammed Ilyas](https://twitter.com/Gbekoilias) was participated in the July 2023 The Numerist Data Challenge. The challenge involved determining the success of SocialBlaze's new app, Ribbon among other requirements.

We carried out some research to provide industry benchmarks and compare the Ribbon app's numbers to the industry average and this was used to determine its success or not, opportunities for acquisition and engagement, and more. From our analysis, research, and presentation to the CEO of Socialblaze, we could shed light on the app's success as well as providing actionable insights to further enhance the growth of the app.

### Problem Statement
6 July, 2023, Socialblaze launched a new social media app called Ribbon. Prior to this, Socialblaze already had a successful social media app called InstantSnaps and the data of InstantSnaps users was linked to the Ribbon app.

A month after the launch of the Ribbon app, the CEO provided a dataset which contains app usage information such as total number of installs, total number of signups, daily active users, posts seen, etc., and the CEO is interested in finding out the following from the data provided

1) If the app is a success, how can the success of the app launch be leveraged to further enhance Socialblaze's products and services?
2) Are there any opportunities for expansion or improvements in user acquisition and engagement?

From the data, the following is expected:
1) A comprehensive report presenting the analysis and insights to the CEO. (Ensuring the choice of delivery is suitable for the audience)
2) Highlight the key findings, emphasizing whether the product launch can be considered a success.
3) Support your conclusions with relevant data visualisations where necessary.
4) Provide actionable recommendations or areas of improvement based on the analysis.
